# SkillSync – Learning & Project Tracker

SkillSync is a Flask-based web application that allows users to add, view, edit, and delete projects.
It was built as part of my learning journey to understand backend development, databases, and how
frontend and backend work together in a real application.

This project focuses on clarity, clean structure, and core concepts rather than complex features.
